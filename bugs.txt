GMT_create_textset() does not set the n_rows field.

We cannot register a grd file and then pass it to a GMT_Module, because it
mistakenly passes the GMT_File_Is_Memory check in GMT_Register_IO.  It then
looks in memory, but cannot find it, because it is, after all, a file.

In general, creating GMT resources that point to user data is problematic.
The GMT API tries to free user-allocated memory all the time, causing crashes
and segmentation faults.  As it is, this means we just need to let memory leak
instead of cleaning up after ourselves.

grdcontour segfaults when there are tic-marks and the contours are not closed.

psxy cannot read data tables from memory when plotting lines/polygons due to
the GMT_Read_Data command for that case not specifying the correct input source.
Instead, it specifies no input, so GMT looks for a single registered input,
finds several, and complains.
