We cannot register a grd file and then pass it to a GMT_Module, because it
mistakenly passes the GMT_File_Is_Memory check in GMT_Register_IO.  It then
looks in memory, but cannot find it, because it is, after all, a file.  Same
thing for cpt files

grdcontour segfaults when there are tic-marks and the contours are not closed.

GMT_Create_Options fails for titles in the -B option because it parses quoted
titles with spaces in it into separate tokens.  When these titles are passed
in through the command line, whatever service that parses that into argc, argv
correctly arguments in quotes together.

GMTAPI_Make_DataObject does not set the S_obj->actual_family field, which can
cause segfaults in GMT_End_IO, which needs to look at that field.
