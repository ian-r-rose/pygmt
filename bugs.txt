GMT_create_textset() does not set the n_rows field.

In general, creating GMT resources that point to user data is problematic.
The GMT API tries to free user-allocated memory all the time, causing crashes
and segmentation faults.  As it is, this means we just need to let memory leak
instead of cleaning up after ourselves.
